# üöÄ GitOps Workflow using ArgoCD on Kubernetes
## üìÑ Project Overview
This project demonstrates a complete **GitOps workflow** using **ArgoCD on Kubernetes (EKS)**. The application used is a simple **Flask app**, containerized with Docker, deployed on AWS-managed Kubernetes (EKS) using **Terraform for infrastructure provisioning** and **Helm for Kubernetes deployments**. CI/CD workflows are automated via **GitHub Actions**, enabling seamless deployment through GitOps principles.

## üîß Tech Stack

- **AWS EKS** ‚Äì Managed Kubernetes service
- **Terraform** ‚Äì Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- **ArgoCD** ‚Äì GitOps deployment tool for Kubernetes
- **Docker** ‚Äì Containerization of Flask App
- **Helm** ‚Äì Kubernetes package manager
- **GitHub Actions** ‚Äì CI pipeline for automation
- **Flask** ‚Äì Python backend application

## üöÄ Workflow Steps

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Flask Application with Docker
- Created a simple **Flask web application**.
- Wrote a **Dockerfile** to containerize the application.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ AWS EKS Infrastructure with Terraform
- Created the entire EKS cluster on AWS using Terraform.
- Includes VPC, IAM roles, node groups, and networking.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ CI Pipeline with GitHub Actions
Configured a GitHub Actions CI pipeline to:
- Build and push Docker images to DockerHub.
- Security Testing
- Update the Helm chart values with the new image tags.
- Commit and push changes to the GitOps repository.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Deployment with ArgoCD (GitOps)
- ArgoCD watches the Helm chart repository.
- Any changes pushed (e.g., new image tag) are automatically deployed to EKS.
- Managed fully via GitOps workflow‚Äîthe Git repo is the single source of truth.
